                    <h3>User review</h3>
                    <p>Capterra: 4.5/5</p>
                    <p>Positive review: Apart from the apparent tracking and monitoring of the teams, I have found desk time to be very helpful in managing my work-life balance. It reminds me to take a break, stand up, stitch, drink some water, etc. This sounds simple, but sometimes you lose track of time, so these tiny reminders help you relax and refocus, making you more productive!</p>
                    <p>Negative review: Exporting reports for hours is not in decimal format, not great for paying employees. It will show productivity, but the same screenshot could be up for two hours. The app needs to recognize the same screen and send notifications to the employer to alert the supervisor of employee misconduct. The report for weekly hours is not alphabetical. The order has no specific purpose.</p>

                    <h3>Best for</h3>

                    <h3>User review</h3>
                    <p>Capterra: 4.5/5</p>
                    <p>Positive review: This tool is part of my day to day use, and it just works 100% of the time. When managing various clients and tasks, the interface makes it dead simple to task-switch and start logging hours in a different or diverse client. When it's time to assess how many hours are left to spend on a client, the reporting is easy to understand and offers great ways to manipulate the data.</p>
                    <p>Negative review: I still feel that the project setup could be simplified and streamlined. I've used Harvest for over ten years, and they have consistently added features and addressed certain gray areas that the software couldn't account for. Still, I do think that if they were rebuilding the platform knowing what they know, they would make it even more straightforward and straightforward from that standpoint.</p>

                    <h3>User review</h3>
                    <p>Capterra: 4.5/5</p>
                    <p>Positive review: I can pace with my work by keeping an eye on Time Doctor and getting proof of my work hours to demand payment. I'm on the Desktop app most of the time, but I use a mobile application that helps track when I'm traveling and working. It also gives an option to edit time manually, and I use it sometimes when I spend time on the phone or forget to launch the application while working.</p>
                    <p>Negative review: The only con I observed as a user is the 'display of activity bar'. It stays on top and sometimes becomes quite irritating. There's an option to hide it, but the chance that sometimes you forget to turn Time Doctor 'On'. Likewise, the break time monitor is a bit irritating. When you're busy thinking and staring at your screen, but you have not moved your mouse or touched the keyboard, Time Doctor will assume that you've gone for a break.</p>
                    <h2>5. TimeCamp: Best free employee time tracking software</h2>

                    <p>Capterra: 4.7/5</p>
                    <p>Positive review: I first tried the trial version of this program which is long enough (30 days) and offers an excellent overview of all the tool's features and how much they can be helpful (even when you have not considered them before!). Other similar means are very restrictive with their time tracking features during this period. TimeCamp allows you to track an employee's time spent on a project. The dashboard will enable you to be updated very fast. The tool is user-friendly and can be set up with some clicks.</p>
                    <p>Negative review: Too many entries for the same task all in a list look cluttered after some time. I also found myself hunting for precisely the report I wanted and coming across a few that I wasn't after before coming to the one I wanted. Perhaps better organization of all the words would be excellent.</p>

                    <p>Capterra: 4.6/5</p>
                    <p>Positive review: Hubstaff does its job well. It monitors employee activity and takes screenshots. In addition, you can create multiple projects and monitor time on each project, monitor the entire team's activities, understand expenses, and add payroll. Hubstaff automatically creates timesheets that show the exact time of an employee's activity. It also allows you to add notes.</p>
                    <p>Negative review: I would say that Hubstaff seems to get a little pressured because of the activity system in place. Freelancers may fall into burnout trying to achieve these impossible productivity standards. Of course, Hubstaff can't claim responsibility for what its users decide to do with it. Still, since it's pretty understandable that we don't necessarily press keys or move the mouse all the time, maybe it would be better if they counted one activity sign every two seconds.</p>

It has both admin and user control panels, and I got great support for my questions. The ability to rapidly have practical insights into what all staff are engaging with and the difficulties they experience in getting their job done.</p>
                    <p>Negative review: The clock in time does not get replicated immediately with the system time. There is a lag, and it takes about 24 hours to copy to the workstation time zone. The reports could still get more updated when I observe the details for the month. I should see the aggregate totals of each employee as a spread and not daily tabular for each employee in one place.</p>

                    <p>Positive review: We like the most that we can categorize activities as productive or unproductive. This helps us have a more accurate report when checking out productivity. It keeps us well informed of which users are accessing ineffective websites or applications. We can also customize the schedule in which the agent keeps track of activities. They can use them without worries during their free time.</p>
                    <p>Negative review: The first time you log in to the dashboard, it's a little weird, and you need some time to find everything, activate the account, and change the settings. While it is swift and easy, the installation is sometimes blocked from antivirus programs.</p>

                    <p>Positive review: As an end-user, I'd say it's pretty simple to use and makes time tracking easy. The UI is really creditable. So overall, I'd love to suggest this tool to business owners looking to make time tracking easy for their employees and themselves. The basics of any time tracking app are tracking employee time. Reports are also beneficial, along with tasks for a project.</p>
                    <p>Negative review: I want to see the time report of different workspaces in one calendar view and graphics in the dashboard, but Clockify does not have this feature. There could be multiple workspace monitoring options in the dashboard and calendar section, making it possible to compare the work spent for different works. For example, adding 2 hours reading on Sunday, without bother paying attention to what time it was.</p>

                    <p>Toggl track works seamlessly because it doesn’t require you to start timing tasks. You will need to put your task aside and then enter them. Toggl Track allows you to track your time, view it in a grid or calendar format, then worry about the details later.</p>
                    <p>It helps you to convert your time into revenue. With mobile and desktop apps, you can work easily from your comfort zone and give maximum efficiency.</p>

                    <p>Positive review: It's straightforward to use, and the FREE version is all I need. I have a little app that runs on my computer that reminds me to track my time if I'm not timing. It is got wrapped up in what I do, so it's easy for me to spend way longer than I anticipated on things. I don't think I'd have developed a clear enough pricing strategy for projects because I literally had no idea how long it took me.</p>
                    <p>Negative review: The reporting is less intuitive than it could be. I've found the lack of subtasks for projects a real constraint if you needed this for complex tasks. When it's time to move the tracked time from Toggl to invoice, it's just not quite smooth. It's still achievable but just a bit more complicated and less capable of managing complexity than some competing time tracking tools.</p>

I can run a report, pull everything into a spreadsheet and send each client a complete snapshot of how much time was spent on which aspects of their business. There is even an app, so if I am not sitting at my desk but doing some work from my tablet or on a call, I can still click the button and track every minute.</p>
                    <p>Negative review: It often crashes, breaks or bugs out, and my team is unable to track our hours in the software. The other very annoying thing is when you manually enter your hours, starting in AM and finishing in the PM. It is easy to leave a timer tracking - even overnight accidentally. Perhaps there could be some way to counter this?</p>

                    <p>Positive review: As an employee, it made my life completing timesheets 95% faster than our old Excel spreadsheet method completing expense reports and linking them to Jobs. It made my life much easier tallying multiple employees and expenses time to one job as a manager. The ease of use in all areas loves the reporting factor and what I can show on our management meetings for the company's project billing.</p>
                    <p>Negative review: It would be helpful to adjust expenses on the admin side after they have been submitted. If a change needs to be made to an expense project/job, the admin can not adjust it. Instead, you have to reject it, have the employee change it and then resubmit it. I was told this kind of report would cost extra because it is customized. It seems to me this would be a natural report for an expense module.</p>

                    <p>Capterra: 4.8/5</p>
                    <p>Positive review: I love Timeneye. I use it every day. It allows me to control the time, of my clients. We cannot make the right decisions without data, and time is our most valuable resource, functional, valuable reports. I love the simplicity of Timeneye, and I trust it. That is vital when my income is based on billable hours.</p>
                    <p>Negative review: It is a stand-alone timer. It integrates with Trello to allow time tracking with Trello, but I would prefer Timeneye's project management system. It would be great to integrate with Quickbooks, so invoicing was seamless. My major con is that I forget how to set up a new project since I don't do enough of them, and there tends to be a gap between setups.</p>

                    <p>Capterra: 4.8/5</p>
                    <p>Positive review: It's great to add the task once and for all. With the invoicing feature, you can see what's been invoiced and what's to be invoiced. Yes, some are invoiced at the end of a project. Because of how it's set up, it's pretty impossible to have logs that don't correspond to a project and a client unless you are really not focused. You can set up hourly rates for tasks, projects, or team members.</p>
                    <p>Negative review: Some issues include the selector window shutting down when you reach the bottom of a list. If you are a little bit unused to the mouse and miss the right moment to click, you have to go back and reselect the client or project. Also, a recent change in the way reports work has forced me to change how I do billing. I find it frustrating but no more so than the unanticipated changes every online service provider makes from time to time.</p>

                    <p>Positive review: For a busy person, wrong with keeping track of time like me, Tick is the solution. The accounts and projects are flexible and very easy to set it up. It helps quickly track time by indicating the time allocated, time billed, and the remaining time hence enabling the user to hit the set target. The best part of it is it integrates well with project management software such as Basecamp, which brings time tracking and budget feedback into the project management workflow.</p>
                    <p>Negative review: It doesn't have a good, easy to use interface. Time budgets are visible or represented until timers are "entered", almost defeating the purpose of showing them in the timer in the first place. It doesn't have a native desktop app, only a sorry excuse for "something". Hours can't be inputted based on the time of day.</p>

The memo needs to be available on the mobile part. It would help if you did not have to switch it to a desktop to see a memo. Choosing a PTO day from the mobile devices and not the desktop would be great.</p>

                    <p>Positive review: This program minimizes any question of employee integrity regarding stolen time. It is also challenging to keep track of how many hours is spent on each job. This tool solves ALL of those problems. With employee GPS tracking, you can easily see that the employee was on-site when they clocked in. Also, the software allows the employees to clock in clock out . This is so important in the construction company!</p>
                    <p>Negative review: The only feature need improvement is the tracking of mileage pay. It would be nice if the app could use its integrated GPS system. When I use QuickBooks Time, I leave the browser up sometimes for weeks at a time. The only issue I've found that when I do that, the schedule entries do not update to the next week automatically.</p>

                    <p>Capterra: 4.6/5</p>
                    <p>Positive review: I have many aspects of projects going on at the same time. For example, audio production, research, video production, and general touching base with all those involved on our end and the clients. I have accountability data. This is of great value!</p>
                    <p>Negative review: We work on multiple jobs every day that must be charged to various accounts. It seems this is how the app is set up, but it appears to be non-functional on our end. I have switched to a different time tracker when I needed only to track the hours spent for billing at another job. I would try TrackingTime again in the future.</p>
